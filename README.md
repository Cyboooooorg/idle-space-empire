## Quick Introduction

This is a simple idle game where you have to build a space empire. You start with a small planet and you have to build a fleet of spaceships to conquer the galaxy. You can also build space stations to produce resources and research new technologies to improve your spaceships.

### How to Install

#### Requirements

This repository uses Docker to run the project. You can install Docker and Docker Compose by following the instructions on their respective websites.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)

This project uses conventional commits to manage the versioning of the project. You can find more information about conventional commits [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

In order to enforce conventional commits, I use **_[cocogitto](https://docs.cocogitto.io)_** which is a tool that checks the commit messages and prevents you from pushing commits that do not follow the conventional commits guidelines. You can install **_cocogitto_** by following the instructions on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto).

> [!NOTE]
> Once you have installed **_cocogitto_**, you will have to run the command `cog install-hook` in the root directory of the project to install the hook that will check your commits.

If you don't want to install **_cocogitto_**, you can still use this repository but you will have to manually check that your commits follow the conventional commits guidelines or you can use the VSCode extension [Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) which will help you write conventional commits.

You can install this project by cloning this repository:

> [!NOTE]
> Please use the SSH link since it is more secure than the HTTPS link.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cyboooooorg/idle-space-empire.git
```
